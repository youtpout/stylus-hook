        <h1>Stylus Hook</h1>
        <p>Welcome to stylus hook, the aim of this project is to create hooks for uniswap v4 directly with Stylus on
            Arbitrum.</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Why use stylus to create hooks ?</h2>
        <p>
            The introduction of hooks has opened up an infinite range of possibilities for defi, but as hooks
            become more complex and handle more and more data, their gas cost becomes exponential, to the point
            where it will be very costly, if not impossible, to use certain pools because of the hook attached.
            <br />
            Thanks to stylus, we can push back the limits of what's possible with hooks, making hooks much more
            complex and managing much more data without necessarily being expensive in terms of gas.
        </p>

        <h2>Actual State</h2>
        <p>This project was created as part of a hackathon. Unfortunately, given the limited time available
            for ahackathon, the project hasn't completely achieved its main objective, which was to create hooks with
            stylus.
            <br />
            It was also necessary to use a different chain from arbitrum sepolia to deploy smartcontracts in
            stylus, which was not compatible with the latest version of Solidity required for uniswap v4 to
            function properly, so a fork of uniswap v4 that differed from the official version had to be created.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that stylus is directly usable on the arbitrum sepolia testnet, which supports the latest
            version of solidity, it will be directly integrated with the official version of uniswap v4.
        </p>

        <h2>Uniswap v4 status</h2>
        <p>
            As Uniswap v4 is not yet finalized, the project will have to be continually updated until the final version
            of uniswap v4 is delivered.
            That's why the audit can't be done before the end of the year, to make sure that the basehooks created will
            be compatible with the latest version of uniswap v4.
        </p>

        <h2>Uniswap v4 in numbers</h2>
        <p>
            Uniswap has achieved 2 trillion in volume since its creation.
            <br />
            Uniswap supports more than 11 networks.
            <br />
            Arbitrum surpasses $150 billion in total transaction volume on Uniswap.
        </p>

        <h2>The goal</h2>
        <p>The aim is for end users to be able to create hooks on Uniswap v4 using stylus, and as the contract will be
            audited, this will give certain users greater peace of mind from a security point of view.
            <br />
            As stylus will be much more competitive from a performance and cost point of view, some large projects may
            be carried out only on Arbitrum, increasing the attraction and use of this blockchain.

        <h2>
            Stylus Hook Roadmap
        </h2>
        <h4>Milestone 1 : delivery scheduled for September 30</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create basehook contract in stylus inspired from original contract in solidity on uniswap v4
                periphery
            </li>
            <li>
                Add support of type uint24, int24 ... on stylus, mandatory to create the basehook contracts
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a functionnality to easily deploy an hook with create2 in stylus to have predicted hook
                address,
                uniswap v4 use the first byte of the adress to determine hook functionnalities
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a simple example of hook with this basehook
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Milestone 2 : delivery scheduled for November 30</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adjust the basehook contract for the latest uniswap v4 update
            </li>
            <li>
                Create more complex examples such as uniswapv4 periphery repos
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a github template repos
            </li>
            <li>
                Create documentation
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Milestone 3 : delivery scheduled for December 31</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Audit the basehook contract
            </li>
        </ul>
    </main>
